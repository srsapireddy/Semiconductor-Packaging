### 1.3.1 Classification and Anatomy of Semiconductor Packages  

Semiconductor packages can be broadly grouped into two main categories:  

#### 🧩 Conventional Packages  
- The wafer is **sawed into dice first**.  
- Each die is then packaged individually.  
- Commonly used in traditional ICs such as **DIP, QFP, and BGA**.  

#### 🧩 Wafer-Level Packages (WLP)  
- A part or all of the **packaging process is performed at the wafer level** before dicing.  
- Results in smaller, thinner, and more cost-effective solutions.  
- Widely adopted in **mobile and consumer electronics** due to their compactness.

- **Wafer-Level Packaging:** Package before dicing → smaller footprint, better electrical/thermal performance, increasingly dominant in advanced applications.  

### 1.3.2 Classification by Package Medium  

📖 *Reference: SK Hynix Newsroom – Semiconductor Back-End Process, Episode 3*  

Depending on the **medium of the package**, semiconductor packages can be categorized as follows:

### 1.4.3 2.5D and 3D Integration  

#### ⚡ 2.5D Integration  
- Multiple dies (e.g., **CPU + HBM**) placed **side-by-side** on a **common interposer**.  
- Interposer provides interconnects instead of the substrate.  
- Popular in **HPC and AI** applications.  
- 📌 Examples: **AMD Instinct MI series**, **NVIDIA GPUs with HBM** (CoWoS).  

#### ⚡ 3D Integration  
- Dies are **stacked vertically** and connected using **Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs)**.  
- Enables ultra-high integration density.  
- Widely used in **3D NAND**, **HBM memory stacks**, and even **logic-on-logic** integration.
